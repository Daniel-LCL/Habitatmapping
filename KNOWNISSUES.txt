Known Issues:

- There can be underestimates of pastoral land in South Africa, Brazil and East Asia due to the conservative pasture mask being used.

- Some coastal cells might not be mapped from level 1 to level 2 owing to a lack of harmonizations between existing combinations of input layers. To be fixed in future versions

- Owing to the scale of the Copernicus land cover and Global Lakes of the World (GLWD) data some rivers can be missed and seasonal dynamics misclassified
